TechBot - A Twitch Bot written in C# running a LUA "container" for each channel.

Goals:
	- Mono-compatible (Primarily Windows and Linux support)

	- Asynchronous LUA and channel threads (Each channel running it's own thread)

	- Modules loaded inside each LUA container by adding module ID to DEPENDENCIES file (Or custom function?)

	- Community distribution of LUA modules

	- Webpanel for administration, managing community modules
	  (ASP.net or Nancy maybe?)

	- Ability for streamer to watch requested videos/songs etc

	- View comment history of user.
	  (Probably should use SQLite for this? Or Web API)

	- Restricted LUA access to prevent server damage.
	  (Should probably use LUA sandbox? Or just restrict working area if that's possible somehow)
